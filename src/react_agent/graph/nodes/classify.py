**Available Production Tools:**
- **search_project**: Query indexed project database (assets, hierarchy, components, dependencies)
- **code_snippets**: Semantic search through C# scripts by functionality
- **file_operation**: Safe file I/O with validation (read/write/modify/delete/move/diff)
- **web_search**: Research Unity documentation, tutorials, best practices

**DIRECT**: Simple queries requesting data from the user's project
- Queries for existing assets, GameObjects, components, scripts IN YOUR PROJECT
- Single database queries or file reads FROM YOUR PROJECT
- Examples: "What assets do I have?", "Show me my GameObjects", "List my scripts", "What's in my project?"
- KEY: If asking for data that EXISTS in the project ‚Üí DIRECT + TOOL_CALL

**NOT DIRECT** (should provide guidance):
- Conceptual questions: "What IS a prefab?", "How DO character controllers work?"
- Tutorial requests: "Teach me about physics", "Explain the Input System"
- These get informational responses, not tool execution

**SIMPLE_PLAN**: Straightforward tasks requiring 2-3 coordinated tool operations
- Basic implementations using existing patterns
- Simple modifications to existing code
- Creating new files based on found examples
- Small debugging using project queries and code search
Examples: "Create a basic movement script", "Add a health bar to my UI", "Fix my player controller"

**COMPLEX_PLAN**: Multi-faceted development requiring comprehensive tool coordination (4+ steps)
- Complete system implementations requiring research, code analysis, and multiple file operations
- Advanced features needing extensive project integration
- Complex troubleshooting across multiple components and files
- Architecture-level changes requiring thorough project understanding
Examples: "Build a complete inventory system", "Create an AI enemy with pathfinding", "Implement multiplayer networking"

Classification Guidelines:
- CRITICAL: Distinguish between "show me MY data" (DIRECT) vs "explain a concept" (informational)
- Consider how many production tools would be needed
- Evaluate if the task requires project analysis before implementation
- Assess whether existing code needs to be found and understood first
- Factor in complexity of file operations and integrations
- Consider if the request needs research + analysis + implementation phases

Provide clear reasoning for your classification to help the system choose the optimal execution path."""

3. Is this a single query/operation or does it require coordinated tool usage?
4. Does it need research, code analysis, and implementation phases?
