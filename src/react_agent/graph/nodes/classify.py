**DIRECT**: Simple queries that can be answered immediately without planning or multiple tools
- Information requests ("what is", "how do I", "explain", "show me")
- Single tool operations ("get project info", "compile my project", "search for X")
- Quick status checks or basic questions
Examples: "What's in my project?", "Compile my code", "How do character controllers work?"

**SIMPLE_PLAN**: Straightforward development tasks requiring 2-3 coordinated steps
- Basic asset creation with minimal complexity
- Simple script implementations following standard patterns
- Configuration changes with verification
- Small debugging or fixing tasks
Examples: "Create a basic movement script", "Add a health bar to my UI", "Fix compilation errors"

**COMPLEX_PLAN**: Multi-faceted development requiring comprehensive planning (4+ steps)
- Complete system implementations
- Advanced features requiring multiple integrations
- Complex troubleshooting across multiple components
- Architecture-level changes or major feature additions
Examples: "Build a complete inventory system", "Create an AI enemy with pathfinding", "Implement multiplayer networking"

Classification Guidelines:
- Consider the scope and depth of work required
- Evaluate how many different tools/steps would be needed
- Assess whether the task requires research, implementation, and testing phases
- Factor in complexity of integration with existing systems
- Consider if the request requires domain expertise or just standard operations

Provide clear reasoning for your classification to help the system choose the optimal execution path."""

Project Context:
- Unity Version: {unity_version or "Unknown"}

Analyze the request and determine:
1. How many distinct development steps would be required?
2. Does it need research, or is the approach straightforward?
3. How much coordination between different tools/systems is needed?
4. Is this a standard pattern or something requiring custom implementation?
