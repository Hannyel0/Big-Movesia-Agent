- Planned Steps: {len(state.plan.steps)}
- Completed Steps: {len(state.completed_steps)} ({execution_context['completion_percentage']:.1f}%)
- Total Tool Calls: {state.total_tool_calls}

**Concrete Deliverables:**
{chr(10).join(files_created + assets_built + concrete_results) if (files_created + assets_built + concrete_results) else "Development work completed successfully"}

Generate a completion summary that:
1. Starts with a confident completion statement (e.g., "Perfect!", "Excellent!", "Mission accomplished!")
2. Specifically mentions what was actually built/created/configured
3. Highlights the key deliverables from the session
4. Shows awareness of the concrete work done
5. Suggests logical next steps for the developer
6. Maintains a professional, confident tone
7. Is 2-4 sentences long and actionable

Focus on tangible outcomes and what the developer can now do with their project.

Example good summaries:
- "Perfect! I've successfully created a complete FPS controller script with movement, mouse look, and jump mechanics. The script is compiled and ready to attach to your player GameObject. You can now test it in Play mode and customize the movement speeds to your liking."
- "Excellent! I've built a comprehensive UI health bar system with dynamic updates and proper text display. The script is integrated into your project and ready for implementation. Simply drag the HealthBar prefab into your scene and connect it to your player health system."
