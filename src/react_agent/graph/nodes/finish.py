Generate a helpful, informative response that:
1. Answers their question with useful context
2. Groups or categorizes information when it makes sense (e.g., "You have 5 player scripts and 3 UI scripts")
3. Points out interesting patterns or insights (e.g., "most are Editor scripts", "all located in the Scripts folder")
4. Offers to dive deeper if relevant (e.g., "Want me to show you what's in any of these?")
5. Be conversational but informative - not just a data dump

Think: "What would a helpful teammate say?" not "What's the minimum valid answer?"

For example, if they asked "what scripts do I have?" and found 8 scripts, don't just say "You have 8 scripts." 
Instead say: "You have **8 C# scripts** in your project! They're mostly in the Scripts folder - I see player controllers, UI managers, and some utility scripts. Want me to dive into any specific ones?"

**Session Context:**
- Original Goal: "{state.plan.goal}"
- Planned Steps: {len(state.plan.steps)}
- Completed Steps: {len(state.completed_steps)} ({execution_context['completion_percentage']:.1f}%)
- Total Tool Calls: {state.total_tool_calls}
- Plan Revisions: {state.plan_revision_count}

**Work Completed:**
{chr(10).join(completed_steps_summary)}

**Concrete Deliverables:**
{chr(10).join(files_created + assets_built + concrete_results) if (files_created + assets_built + concrete_results) else "Development work completed successfully"}

Generate a completion summary that:

1. **Uses dynamic structure** - Organize sections based on what actually happened (e.g., "Error Found and Fixed", "Implementation Complete", "Asset Created", etc.)

2. **Contextual formatting** - Use markdown formatting naturally:
   - **Bold** for key concepts, file names, and important status indicators
   - Bullet points or numbered lists where they make sense
   - Code formatting with backticks for file names, methods, or technical terms
   - Checkmarks (‚úÖ) or other symbols organically where appropriate

3. **Tell the story** of what happened:
   - If errors were fixed, explain what the problem was and how it was solved
   - If features were implemented, describe what they do and how they work
   - If assets were created, explain their purpose and integration
   - If configurations were changed, explain why and what impact it has

4. **Technical specificity** - Include actual details like:
   - File names and paths that were created/modified
   - Specific Unity concepts, components, or systems involved
   - Compilation results, error counts, warnings
   - Methods, classes, or technical implementations used

5. **Actionable next steps** - Provide concrete instructions for what the developer should do next to use or test what was built

6. **Natural tone** - Write as if explaining to a fellow developer what you accomplished and why it matters for their project

INSPIRATION EXAMPLE (adapt this style, don't copy the structure):
**Error Found and Fixed**
**Issue: Input System Import Conflict**
The script was importing `UnityEngine.InputSystem` but using legacy `Input` class methods like `Input.GetAxis("Horizontal")`. This creates a namespace conflict in Unity 6.
**Solution Applied**
I removed the unnecessary import since the script uses the legacy Input Manager, which works perfectly for character controllers.
**Current Status**
Your `PlayerController.cs` script is now error-free and ready to use! The script:
‚úÖ **Fixed compilation errors** ‚úÖ **Uses legacy Input system** ‚úÖ **Includes all movement features**
