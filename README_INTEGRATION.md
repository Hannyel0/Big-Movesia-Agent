# Enhanced Narration Integration Guide

## Quick Integration Steps

### 1. Add the new narration module
Place `narration.py` in your `react_agent` directory alongside your existing files.

### 2. Update your graph.py imports
Add these imports at the top of `graph.py`:

```python
from react_agent.narration import (
    NarrationEngine, 
    StreamingNarrator,
    integrate_narration_engine
)
```

### 3. Replace key node functions

Replace your existing `act` and `assess` functions with the enhanced versions from `graph_updates.py`, or apply these specific changes:

#### In the `act` function:
```python
# After line where you get current_step, add:
narration_engine = NarrationEngine()
step_context = {
    "step_index": state.step_index,
    "total_steps": len(state.plan.steps),
    "goal": state.plan.goal,
    "tool_name": current_step.tool_name,
    "description": current_step.description
}

# Replace your simple step_message with:
from react_agent.narration import NarrationEngine
engine = NarrationEngine()
# Use rich pre-step narration instead of create_dynamic_step_message
pre_step_message = f"**Step {state.step_index + 1}/{len(state.plan.steps)}**: {current_step.description}\n\n"
if current_step.tool_name == "search":
    pre_step_message += "I'm researching the latest Unity best practices and documentation..."
elif current_step.tool_name == "write_file":
    pre_step_message += "Creating your script with production-ready code..."
# ... etc
```

#### In the `assess` function, after getting tool results:
```python
# After extracting tool_result from ToolMessage:
if tool_result and current_step.tool_name:
    narration_engine = NarrationEngine()
    step_context = {
        "step_index": state.step_index,
        "total_steps": len(state.plan.steps),
        "goal": state.plan.goal,
        "tool_name": current_step.tool_name
    }
    
    # Generate rich narration from tool output
    post_tool_narration = narration_engine.narrate_tool_result(
        current_step.tool_name,
        tool_result,
        step_context
    )
    
    # Add to messages
    messages_to_add = [AIMessage(content=post_tool_narration)]
```

### 4. Update your context.py (optional)
Add this field to enable verbose narration:

```python
verbose_narration: bool = field(
    default=True,
    metadata={
        "description": "Enable rich, detailed narration of tool outputs"
    }
)
```

## What This Implementation Does

### 1. **Rich Tool Output Mining** âœ…
- Extracts concrete details from every tool result (file paths, line counts, compilation stats)
- Creates contextual narration specific to each tool type
- No more generic "Step completed" messages

### 2. **Structured + Voice Approach** âœ…
- Keeps your structured output for control flow (good!)
- Adds a rich narration layer on top for user communication
- Best of both worlds: type safety + engaging prose

### 3. **Progressive UI Updates** (Optional) âœ…
- If using LangGraph UI, supports streaming updates
- Shows live progress indicators during execution
- Updates in place without cluttering the chat

### 4. **Token-Efficient with Caching** âœ…
- Static prompts go first for OpenAI prompt caching
- Dynamic content only where needed
- Rich narration without token explosion

## Example Output Comparison

### Before (Current):
```
Step 1/3: Searching for Unity FPS controller tutorials...
[Tool executes]
âœ… Step 1 completed. Moving to step 2...
```

### After (With Enhanced Narration):
```
**Step 1/3**: Researching current Unity best practices and tutorials...

I'm looking for the most up-to-date and authoritative sources to ensure we're following modern game development patterns.

[Tool executes]

ðŸŽ¯ **Retrieved 8 authoritative sources on Unity development:**

â€¢ Unity Documentation: First Person Controller Setup
â€¢ Brackeys Tutorial: Complete FPS Controller 2024

These provide exactly the implementation patterns we need. The Unity docs show the new Input System approach while Brackeys covers optimization techniques.

Excellent! Now let's analyze your project structure to ensure compatibility...
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Concrete Details**: Narration now includes actual file names, line counts, error messages
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Technical details in verbose mode, clean summaries in normal mode
3. **Natural Transitions**: Smooth flow between steps with contextual bridges
4. **Error Context**: Helpful explanations when things go wrong, not just "error occurred"
5. **Completion Summaries**: Rich final summary of what was built, not just "task complete"

## Performance Considerations

- **Token Usage**: ~20-30% increase in output tokens, but much richer UX
- **Latency**: Minimal impact due to prompt caching for static segments
- **Caching**: Static tool descriptions and system prompts cached across turns

## Testing the Integration

1. Run a simple test:
```python
from react_agent.graph import graph
from react_agent.context import Context

context = Context(verbose_narration=True)
result = await graph.ainvoke(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Create a player movement script")]},
    {"context": context}
)
```

2. Check that narration includes:
   - Specific file paths when files are created
   - Line counts and code metrics
   - Compilation results with warning details
   - Project-specific information

## Customization Options

### Adjust Narration Style
In `narration.py`, modify the narration templates in each `_narrate_*` method to match your tone.

### Add Tool-Specific Details
Extend the `tool_narrators` dictionary with custom narrators for any new tools you add.

### Control Verbosity
Use the `verbose` flag to toggle between concise and detailed narration:
```python
engine = NarrationEngine(verbose=True)  # More technical details
engine = NarrationEngine(verbose=False) # Cleaner, user-friendly only
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Narration seems generic
- **Fix**: Ensure tool results are properly parsed as JSON in the assess function

**Issue**: Too verbose
- **Fix**: Set `verbose=False` in NarrationEngine initialization

**Issue**: Token costs too high
- **Fix**: Reduce the number of narration alternatives in each `_narrate_*` method

## Next Steps

1. **A/B Test**: Compare user satisfaction with/without rich narration
2. **Customize**: Tailor narration style to your specific domain
3. **Extend**: Add narration for new tools as you add them
4. **Monitor**: Track token usage and adjust verbosity as needed
